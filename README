This is the official library for the NXT Shield for Arduino. This enables one to control two NXT motors and use one NXT ultrasonic sensor easily.

The NXT Shield can be bought at our website: http://shop.tkjelectronics.dk/product_info.php?products_id=29 or you can make one yourself. The design files can be found in the "PCB" folder.
